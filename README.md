## Installation

To set up the ERC20 Tokens Price Oracle on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/qwenteenn/erc20-tokens-price-oracle.git
   cd erc20-tokens-price-oracle
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Deno installed. If not, visit the [Deno installation guide](https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation) for instructions. Then run:
   ```bash
   deno run --allow-net --allow-read mod.ts
   ```

3. **Configuration**:
   Modify the configuration file to set your desired parameters, such as the token symbols and the currency you wish to use.

4. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the following command to start the price oracle:
   ```bash
   deno run --allow-net mod.ts
   ```

5. **Access the API**:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/api/prices` to see the available token prices.

## Usage

The ERC20 Tokens Price Oracle provides a simple API for fetching token prices. Here‚Äôs how to use it:

### Fetching Prices

To get the price of a specific ERC20 token, send a GET request to the following endpoint:

```
GET /api/prices?symbol=<TOKEN_SYMBOL>&currency=<CURRENCY>
```

### Example Request

To fetch the price of the DAI token in USD, you would use:

```
GET /api/prices?symbol=DAI&currency=USD
```

### Example Response

The API will return a JSON object with the token price:

```json
{
  "symbol": "DAI",
  "currency": "USD",
  "price": "1.00"
}
```
